title: Data Science in Practice
---
This is my modest attempt to put Tools/Technologies prevalent in the Data Science Space together in one place and build hypothetical use cases with them.

Given that this space is changing as we blink, with new tools being added and the industry norms changing rapidly this might not cover everything under the sun.

Microsoft PowerPoint dictionary gave a spell check error for the names of the tools, which justifies its perfectly fine that I do not know most of what is depicted below.

In order to build use cases which cover most of these, I will try to combine 2+ tools and frame multiple use cases in the next few months with working solutions across tools and technologies.

What I have observed in my experience of past 5 years is - most of us are good at R,SAS,Python etc. But when it comes to build a standalone DS Tool / Application we all falter at the interaction points or are unaware of mechanisms to make it work.

After all a great algorithm, a colorful visualization, or a complex architecture which business cant consume is no better than NULL.



This is my small attempt to continuously evolve and be on top of the fast moving Data Science industry.

Data Science Gurus - Any kind of inputs on what might be missing in the above will be helpful.

PS: Inspired by well known Data Science Metro map.
